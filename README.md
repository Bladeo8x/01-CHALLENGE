## | USER STORY |
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## | ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA |
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

> ### TITLE ELEMENT

* The tittle was modified to be more `CONCISE` and `DESCRIPTIVE`, 

> ### HEADING ATTRIBUTES

* The headings were modified in their specific order, and were merges and reformated for a cleaner code in HTML & CSS.

> ### ICON AND IMAGE ELEMENTS

* 

> ### STRUCTURE OF HTML ELEMENTS

## | MOCK-UP |

The following image demostrates the aftermath of the website in apperance, and functionality:

> ### LINK : <a
 
<!-- ADDED A META DESCRIPTION TO IMPROVE SEARCH ENGINES -->

<!-- CHANGED TITLE WEBSITE FOR A MORE CONCISE DESCRIPTIVE ONE -->

<!-- CHANGE DIV TAGS (NON-SEMANTIC ELEMENTS) FOR SEMANTIC ELEMENTS: HEADER | NAV | MAIN | SECTION | ARTICLE | ASIDE | FOOTER | -->

<!-- FIXED BROKEN LINK CONNECTED WITH A MISSING ID ON THE CONTENT, REFORMATED SOME CSS ATTRIBUTES FOR A CLEANER CODE, ADDED ALT ATTRIBUTES TO IMG AND VECTORS, ADAPTED TEXT SIZING, THE CORNERS OF THE FORMAT WERE ROUNDED FOR A MORE FRIENDLY VISUAL, AND MARGINS WERE ADJUSTED, INCLUDING JUSTIFYNG-TEXTS IN SECTION AND ASIDE ELEMENTS-->

THE CSS WAS REFORMATED, CHANGUING THE ORDER TO FOLLOW THE HTML STRUCTURE, AND UNNECESARY TAGS WERE DELETED.

/* NAV ADDED TO SPECIFY TOP CONTENT */

/* ADDING A HOVER EFFECT FOR THE NAV ELEMENTS TO GET A BETTER VISUAL RESULT  */

/* ADDED MAIN AS A GENERAL CONTAINER FOR THE MAIN ARTICLES OF WEBSITE */

/* ARTCICLE HAS BEEN ADDED, WITH SOME EXTRA ATTRIBUTES LIKE RADIUS AND HOVER */

/* HEADERS AND P WERE MERGED AS 1 TO MAINTAIN THE CODE CLEANER */

/* JUSTYFIED TEXT TO THE CENTER, SEPARATED TEXT FROM MAIN ARTICLE, BETTER VISUALS, SIMPLYFIED THE CODE REMOVING UNECESSARY OR EXTRA CSS TAGS, A FLEXBOX WAS USED TO MERGE MULTIPLE TAGS INTO ONE */

/* GIVING A FLEX-DIRECTION COLUMN TO MAINTAIN THE VERTICAL ASIDE ROW ON THE RIGHT */
